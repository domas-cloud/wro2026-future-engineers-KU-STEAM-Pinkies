# 🛞 Steering System – Concept Description

## Core Idea
One of the proposed steering concepts is a mechanism based on **three interconnected gears**. This approach aims to provide precise control of the front wheel steering angle and ensure smooth maneuvering on the track.

The main idea is that a central gear receives the steering input and transfers its rotation evenly to two outer gears. This keeps both sides synchronized and allows the steering angle to change proportionally to the control signal.

## Mechanical Structure Concept
The planned gear layout consists of:
- **Central gear** – acts as the main input element.
- **Left and right gears** – rotate together with the central gear and control the steering motion on both sides.

This structure could provide:
- smooth mechanical movement,
- equal rotation on both sides,
- minimal mechanical backlash,
- stable and accurate steering control.

## Conceptual Operation Principle
The steering input would rotate the central gear, which then simultaneously transfers movement to the two outer gears. Through  linkages, this rotation would adjust the angle of the front wheel assembly.

This would allow the robot to:
- perform precise turns,
- smoothly correct its direction,
- maintain stability even with small steering adjustments.

## Preliminary Conclusion
This three-gear steering concept appears suitable for further exploration and prototyping.  
It has the potential to deliver accurate, stable, and reliable steering control, which is essential for effective robot maneuverability on the WRO track.
